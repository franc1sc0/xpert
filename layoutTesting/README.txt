To run this project, you will need the latest version of the Selenium library. For simplicity, download the standalone jar from https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list and add it to your classpath.

Note that this is a rewrite of the original tool due to licensing terms with Fujitsu Labs of America. Here are some differences:
- The tool only checks for layout issues using the relative layout detection algorithm mentioned in the paper.
- The new tool only provides command line output unlike the HTML reports generated by the tool in the paper.

You can create bugs/issues on github.
