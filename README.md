Cross-Platform Error ReporTer

This tool is the open source implementation for our X-PERT paper
Note that this is a rewrite of the original tool due to licensing terms with Fujitsu Labs of America. 

Here are some differences:
- The tool ~~only~~ checks for ~~layout~~ *ALL* issues described in the paper. 
- The new tool only provides command line output in CSV format unlike the HTML reports generated by the tool in the paper.


# Running X-PERT via its Web front-end

### Install the gevent and flask python packages: 
```
pip install gevent flask
```
If you don't have pip, [see pip install here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)

### Start the web app
```
cd xpert/web
python app.py
```
It should start the web app on port 8000. Use your web browser to open http://localhost:8000 and navigate through the wizard.

# Running X-PERT via Command line

### Crawl
```
java -cp xpert.jar CrawlDriver <options>
```

### Compare
```
java -cp xpert.jar edu.gatech.XpertMain <options>
```

# Troubleshooting

If things seem broken, you might need to update the Selenium library and perhaps Chrome and IE Driver.
(if you are trying to use the latest versions of these browsers.)
These files are located inside the `exec` folder.

You can find the latest versions of these files form the selenium website. Download the latest selenium standalone jar from https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list

# Issues
You can create bugs/issues on github.
Incase of any questions you can also email shauvik [at] gatech {dot} edu
