Cross-Platform Error ReporTer


To run this project, you will need the latest version of the Selenium library and perhaps Chrome and IE Driver (if using latest versions of these browsers).
These files are located inside `exec` folder.
You can download the latest selenium standalone jar from https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list

Note that this is a rewrite of the original tool due to licensing terms with Fujitsu Labs of America. 

Here are some differences:
- The tool ~~only~~ checks for ~~layout~~ *ALL* issues described in the paper. 
- The new tool only provides command line output in CSV format unlike the HTML reports generated by the tool in the paper.

You can create bugs/issues on github.
Incase of any questions you can also email shauvik [at] gatech {dot} edu
